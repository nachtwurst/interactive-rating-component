## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use JavaScript alongside HTML. The syntax was difficult for me, since I've only really used Python in the past, but I managed to put something together. My CSS and HTMl are generally improving, too, though I haven't done anything too strenuous.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more JavaScript, and its best practices.
